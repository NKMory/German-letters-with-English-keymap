# German-letters-with-English-keymap
 With this script you won't need German keymap anymore!
Takes input from your keyboard anywhere on your pc, lets you change:
-- vowels to vowels with umlauts by typing two dots after them (turns "a.." to "ä", "A.." to "Ä" etc.)
-- sss and SSS to "ß"
In order for it to work letters and dots from the combinations need to be typed consequently, 
the script won't change the letters if you type something like "a.,." even if you delete the comma. 
This allows to cancel the replacement if you need to actually type "a.." by typing anything 
except the dot and erasing it before continuing.
